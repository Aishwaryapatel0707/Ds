Write algorithm for infix to postfix evaluation?
Algorithm Evaluate( ):
Description: 
Here Pis apostfix expression and this algorithm evaluates it.
1.Add a “)” right parenthesis at the end of P.
2.Scan P from left to right and repeat steps 3 & 4 for each element of P until “)” is 
Encountered.
3.If an operand is encountered, push it onto stack.
4.If an operator is encountered then:
(a)Pop the top two elements from stack, where A is the
Top element and B is the next to top element.
(b)Evaluate B A.
©Place the result of (b)back on stack.
[End of Step 4 If]
[End of step 2 For Loop]
5.Set VALUE equal to the top element on the stack.
6.Exit.
